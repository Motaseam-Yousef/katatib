# Katatib

## Description

Katatib is a Saudi-based initiative aimed at assisting students with their curriculum inquiries. Our goal is to provide instant, accessible support for students anytime, anywhere. At the heart of Katatib is Miki, a chatbot programmed to engage with you on questions from the Intermediate education stage in the Saudi curriculum. Miki can be tailored to incorporate your instructor's voice for a more personalized learning experience.

## Idea

The overarching idea is to:

1. Enable students to ask questions about their curriculum at any time and from any location.
2. Facilitate meaningful discussions around these questions to foster deeper comprehension.
3. Empower Saudi students to have a clearer understanding of their curriculum.
